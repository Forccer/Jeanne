# Jeanne
This code is the rewrite of Jeanne d'Arc, it is not completed yet and many things are wrong.
Note that this code is currently not running on the actualy bot yet because of that!
I expect to finish the rewrite by the end of next week which is February 6th

Jeanne is created with Eris a NodeJS library https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris
Jeanne has her own website at https://jeannedarc.xyz
Join her support guild with https://discord.gg/Vf4ne5b
You can invite the bot to your server with https://jeannedarc.xyz/invite

Open-Source

Jeanne is open-source under the GNU GPLv3 License. If you use any of my code in your own project(s) you are required to credit me. See license for more details. (Open-Source does NOT mean that you can selfhost the bot!)
