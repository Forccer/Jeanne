# Jeanne
This code is the rewrite of Jeanne d'Arc, it is not completed yet and many things are wrong.<br/>
Note that this code is currently not running on the actualy bot yet because of that!<br/>
I expect to finish the rewrite by the end of next week which is February 6th
<br/><br/>
Jeanne is created with Eris a NodeJS library https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris<br/>
Jeanne has her own website at https://jeannedarc.xyz<br/>
Join her support guild with https://discord.gg/Vf4ne5b<br/>
You can invite the bot to your server with https://jeannedarc.xyz/invite
